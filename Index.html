            <p>
                Howdy folks. I'm Kit (they/them), a BICT student in Finland.
                <br>
                I moved to Finland late 2020 during the panini (Covid-19 pandemic) with my partner due to a job offer they received. 
                I'm originally from South Africa, but will be staying in Finland permanently. 
                <br>

                I am a final year student at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences (AMK) completing a bachelor's degree in 
                Business Information Technology.
                <br>
                My major is in Software Engineering, with an additional focus on Video Game Development.
                <br>
                I have focused my courses on frontend, backend, and mobile programming, supplemented with 3D modeling and 
                game development courses.
                <br>
                <br>
                My estimated graduation date is Fall 2024 or Spring 2025. At present I need only complete a thesis and internship to graduate.
                <br>
                <br>
                I love gaming in all of its forms, from card and tabletop RPGs, to video games on various platforms. 
                <br>
                You can find me playing Merge Mansion, Angry Birds Dream Blast and Wuthering Waves on mobile.
                <br>
                I love Baldur's Gate 3, The Sims, Lost Ark, and Cult of the Lamb on PC. For PS5 console, Genshin Impact stays on top, though
                I do also love Diablo, It Takes Two and Stray.
                <br>
                By now you might be able to tell that I love fantasy, adventure, storytelling, and world-building.
                <br> 
                When I'm not playing games, I'm learning how to make them, check out my Unity Play to see some of the projects 
                I've been working on.

                <br>
                My other interests are reading/watching fantasy, spending time outdoors with my dog, and visiting anime conventions in 
                the summertime.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm part of the LGBTQIA+ community; equality and inclusivity are of paramount importance to me.
                <br>
                My values are integrity, kindness and honesty.
                <br>
                <br>
                I work hard and do my best, I'm shy but a quick learner.
                <br>
                My biggest strengths are innovation, creativity and determination.
                <br>
                These combine into my super strength: figuring it out. 
                <br>
                If I don't know how to do something, I use my innovation, creativity and determination to figure out how to do it.
